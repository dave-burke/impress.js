	<!-- To explain how transactions get validated, I need to explain what
	a hash is.  A hash is:
		- Easy to computer in one direction
		- Effectively impossible to reverse

	If I hash "test" I get some output. The output is the same every time,
	but if I change just one letter, the output changes completely.

	Imagine you go to the library, pick out a book and write down
	the first letter of every page. If you gave those letters to
	someone, they would have no way to know which book it came
	from, unless they looked at every book. On the other hand, if
	you gave someone the book and asked them to write the first
	letter of every page, they would produce exactly the same note
	that you did.  You could easily confirm that you both used the
	same book just by comparing notes.

	You can easily make a note of first characters from a book, but
	you can't get a book out of the list of first characters.
	That's what we mean when we say a hash is a one way function.

	<!-- When a computer validates a block, they do so by finding a hash
	that begins with a certain number of zeroes. They take all the data
	that goes into the block: A reference to the previous block plus all
	the new transactions, and they add an extra number and hash all that
	together.  They keep trying different numbers until they find one that
	gives them a hash output with the required leading zeroes.  The number
	that finally makes the right hash is the official seal of approval for
	the new block.  Notice how the last transaction is me giving a coin to
	myself. That's my reward for solving the puzzle. It's my motivation to
	spend my computing power to participate in making the network function.

	The more zeroes we require, the harder it is to find a
	solution, so we can make the puzzles easier or harder depending
	on how many people are working on them. We want the solution to
	be hard enough so that we don't have everyone in the network
	making different valid blocks at the same time.  -->
