# Bitcoin: Money without the Middleman

This is a presentation I did for Toastmasters about Bitcoin. It's based on the incredible [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js). My speaker notes are in the [HTML source](btc.html).

If you want to learn more about Bitcoin, see [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org), this [excellent technical description](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/), or [the original technical paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).
